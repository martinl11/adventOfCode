As well, ensure your computer have maven building tool.
you can find it in [here](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac).

If you run the application using command line tool, you can run the following command:
```shell script
mvn install
```

Or, if you have IDE (such as `Intellij`), you can just run maven build there.
