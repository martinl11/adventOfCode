## How to Run test case

First of all, make sure you have installed jdk in your computer.
You can find it in [here](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_HowTo.html). 

As well, ensure your computer have maven building tool.
you can find it in [here](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac).

If you run the application using command line tool, you can run the following command:
```shell script
mvn clean install
```

Or, if you have IDE (such as `Intellij`), you can just run maven build there.  

## How to Read test

For each puzzle, I have included four test cases for the solution.

1. `default test`, with input given by adventOfCode
2. `simple test`, with simple input from example
3. `fail test`, with input that lead to a wrong output
4. `random test`, with random input testing exception handling.
